Big Challenge for 27/01
Today, I encountered a significant challenge in my project.
While I was excited to create the ball and the players and see them appear on the screen, I ran into an issue when the ball’s bounces started to increase in speed. I had a hard time figuring out how to stabilize the ball's movement. Additionally, another challenge was determining the correct conditions to make the ball bounce properly on the players, based on where it collided with them.

After some experimentation and debugging, I was able to solve the issue and achieve the desired behavior for the ball's bouncing, making it more consistent and controlled during the game. This was a major learning experience, and I’m really proud of how the logic has come together!
