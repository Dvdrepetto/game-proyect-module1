## Introduction 

**The game is called The Sharingan. Your goal is to survive until level 10 to achieve victory. As you may know, the Sharingan does not activate automatically at birth. It only awakens when the heir of the Kekkei Genkai experiences extreme stress or emotional trauma. Thatâ€™s why surviving the game is essential to unlocking it. Are you ready?!**
